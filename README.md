# Working with a REST API

This is a simple example of how working with a REST API may look like, done in React.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/farrelmahaztra/react-with-api.git
```

2. Move into the directory

```
cd react-with-api
```

3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

4. Run the app

```
npm start
```

## Notes

- Like with last week's state management talk, this isn't the only way to work with a REST API from a frontend. There's plenty to improve!
